NodeJS
- whenever you see the require('some-package') is a commonJS syntax for importing packages
- global is an object that contain all the global variables so you can access it from anywhere within your project.
	- which contain functions like setInterval etc...
- there are also some global values that you can access it anywhere from the nodejs project
	- __dirname return the current path of the folder that you are in
	- __filename return the current file name that you are in
	- process return an object contain meta data about the process and system
- Core Packages that come with Nodejs AKA common core modules
	- os
	- path
		- contain functions like:
			- path.dirname(__filename) return the same value as __dirname
			- path.basename(__filename) return the name of the file without the extension like .txt .html ect...
			- path.extname(__filename) return the extension name of the file
			- path.parse(__filename) return an object that contain meta data about the file such as path, ext, folder, root etc...
	- fs
		-functions you use:
			- fs.existsSync
				- check if the folder exists
		- for reading and writing files, normally you want the promises of it. since you want to write async code
			- fsPromises = require('fs').promises, they contain functions like
				- writeFile
				- appendFile
				- renameFile
			- make sure you use async infront of those operations

	- events
		- create a class that extend the events class, create a new instance of the class,
			- myEmitter.on("eventName" callback(args...))
			- myEmitter.emit("eventName", args...)
	- http
		- createServer function help you start on getting request and sending response



i have no fucking ideal why the favicon.ico getting requested no fucking clude aaaaaaaaa
	- is likly some default call from html file, we can just ignore it
	

ExpressJS
	- create a instance by calling the app = express()
	- app.get take in a url-path and callback which it take in a request and response object
		- the url-path param also accpect regx
	- middlewares
		- routerHandlers is baically a middlewares 
		- middlewares are anything you do that between the request and response
			- 3 types of middlewares
				- buildin
				- customs
				- 3party
	- app.use does not accpect regex in older version however in newer version it does support regex
	- difference between app.all and app.get
VS-code short cuts
	shift+alt+down-arrow: whatever is being highlighted get copy and paste direct blow
	contrl+D+click: allow you edit all the same name in that file

3rd Party Packages:
	- jsonwebtoken (JWT)
		- to create a token
			- you need a secret key, make sure no one but you have access to it
			- data that you wanted to encode into the token, after decoding the token you can use those data to vaildate
			- use the .sign function to create the token
		- in auth flow you want to generate two type of tokens
			- access token
				- access token allow you to access projected apis
				- this token generally expire in 5 to 10 min shot life span
				- for frontend dev make sure store this token in memory, NOT local storage or cookies
					- that way if the user close the application the token will be gone
			- refresh token
				- refresh token allow you to request another access token, once the old one expired
				- this token have a longer life span between few days
				- you can make this token last forever but not recommented 
				- for frontend dev store this token in a httpOnly cookies, that way you cant get it using javascript, however is still not 100% safe


	- bcrypt
	- cors
		- before applying the cors options, you need to set "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials" in the header and set it to "true"
	- dotenv
	- cookie-parser


	for frontned
		- if you use fetch to access this auth route
			- you need to set the option "credentials: include"
		- if you use axios you also need to set a flag
